The 211 project seeks to deliver facts about average people: their needs, requests, and services they ask for from data sourced from United Ways locations across each state. Currently, we are working on gathering data available from the Wisconsin department and will further expand our outreach to additional states as we build our proof-of-concept. The main deliverable will be handled with ArcGIS, where we can create a geospatial dashboard that displays the statistics we choose to cover before and after the COVID-19 pandemic.
