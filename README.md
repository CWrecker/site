## Syntax guidelines
Basic linting format
Spaces between “=” and one-lined “{}”
Always use curly braces on if statements and loops
Use comments, but not too much
When using certain text-editors, you can use built-in linterse
VSCODE - ESLint extension
Follow React.js best practices
Avoid using custom CSS, use the “theme-ui” instead
Use the same coding-style as used currently
If you are not sure if you should delete some code, just comment it out temporarily
Developer workflow
We solely use GitHub
We do not use Trello anymore
Issues + Pull Requests
Access
Co-Leads + Fernanda have admin access
Members have triage access
Co-Leads will assign tasks to those who are inactive/not working on anything
All communication happens in the private “website-project” channel on CVT
When working on the website, you can do any of the 3 things:
Work from an issue
Pick an issue
Make sure you assign yourself to the task
Makes sure that no one else is working on the task
Be sure to work on your own branch
You can pull requests with your own branch, you can’t push changes directly to the master
Once you’re done, make a pull request
Doesn’t merge changes into master immediately
Also lets Netlify run checks before merge
One of the Co-Leads will look at your PR and merge it or tell you to make changes
Testing the website
Go on our deployed website and test for any bugs
Not e2e/unit tests, just regular user tests
Any bugs that are found should be filed as an issue
Make sure you use the right tags!
Don’t assign anyone other than yourself
Redesign the website
Work off of the Figma file in “Important Links”
Let everyone in the channel know what changes you made and when you made them
Activity/time commitment
There is no set number of hours you must work each day
We expect you to constantly be working on tasks and helping improve the website most of the days of the week
The community manager (Calix) will oversee everyone’s progress and work
Those who do not contribute up to the standard are in risk of being kicked off of the website team
Support
If you need any help, reach out to any of the Co-Leads!
